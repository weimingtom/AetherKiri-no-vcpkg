# AetherKiri Development Guide

[English](development.md) | [简体中文](development.zh-CN.md)

This document is the main engineering reference for AetherKiri. It covers the
current Godot-native architecture, repository layout, important files, build
flows, test flows, probe configuration, platform notes, and debugging habits.

## Current Product Shape

AetherKiri is a Godot-hosted KiriKiri2 runtime:

```text
Godot App Shell
  -> Godot 4.6 GDExtension Host
    -> C ABI Engine Bridge
      -> C++ Engine Core
        -> KiriKiri Runtime / Plugins
```

The product path is the Godot app in `apps/godot_app`.

## Rendering Architecture

The app exposes three renderer choices in the Godot settings UI:

| Backend | Role | Production target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Godot Native | Default Godot-owned GPU rendering path. Textures and render resources are owned by Godot and displayed directly by the Godot UI. | Yes |
| GPU Bridge | Compatibility/performance bridge for external native GPU render targets imported into Godot. | Yes, as explicit fallback/comparison |
| Debug CPU | RGBA readback/upload fallback. Useful for debugging correctness when GPU paths are suspect. | No |

CPU upload must remain a debug fallback. Performance work should target Godot
Native first, then GPU Bridge where native coverage is incomplete.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/godot_app/` | Godot project, scene, scripts, assets, export presets, and GDExtension descriptor. |
| `bridge/godot_extension/` | C++ GDExtension classes exposed to Godot, including the host node/player binding. |
| `bridge/engine_api/` | Stable C ABI between the Godot host and the engine core. Keep this narrow and versionable. |
| `cpp/core/` | KiriKiri runtime core: script VM, storage, events, window/layer system, rendering, audio, movie, and plugin infrastructure. |
| `cpp/plugins/` | Built-in plugin implementations and compatibility adapters registered as KiriKiri plugins. |
| `build/` | Platform build entry scripts and validation scripts. |
| `tests/` | Unit tests, fixtures, and generic probe profiles. Committed test profiles must not contain local absolute game paths. |
| `tools/` | Developer tools such as XP3 helpers and plugin audit utilities. |
| `vcpkg/` | Local vcpkg ports and triplets used by this project. |
| `.devtools/vcpkg/` | Optional local vcpkg checkout. This directory is ignored and can be recreated. |
| `doc/` | Engineering documentation. Start here for development notes. |

## Build Prerequisites

Required for normal development:

- macOS with Xcode command line tools for macOS/iOS builds.
- CMake 3.28+ and Ninja.
- Godot 4.6.3 stable at `/Applications/Godot.app`, or set `GODOT_BIN`.
- Godot export templates for the platforms you build.
- vcpkg in `.devtools/vcpkg` or `VCPKG_ROOT`.

Android also needs:

- Android SDK and NDK.
- `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`, otherwise the scripts try
  `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk`.

Web also needs:

- Emscripten/emsdk with `emcc`, `em++`, and `emar` on `PATH`.
- Godot Web GDExtension/dlink export templates installed under the Godot export
  template directory as `web_dlink_debug.zip` and
  `web_dlink_release.zip`.
- Node.js and npm for the TypeScript/Vite local Web server.

Useful environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GODOT_BIN` | Override Godot executable path. |
| `GODOT_EXPORT_TEMPLATE` | Override a platform export template zip. |
| `GODOT_TEMPLATE_DIR` | Override the Godot export template directory, useful for Web dlink templates. |
| `VCPKG_ROOT` | Override vcpkg checkout. |
| `EMSDK` / `EMSCRIPTEN_ROOT` | Emscripten SDK/toolchain location for Web builds. |
| `AETHERKIRI_GAME_ROOT` / `AETHERKIRI_GAME_ROOTS` | Vite-only local Web game roots for read-only RangeFS testing. |
| `AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START` | Vite-only local Web switch to mount and start the configured game automatically. |
| `AETHERKIRI_ENABLE_AUTO_START` | Native desktop automation opt-in. Without it, stale `AETHERKIRI_AUTO_START_GAME` or `AETHERKIRI_AUTO_OPEN` values are ignored by normal debug/release apps. |
| `JOBS` | Parallel native build jobs. |
| `IOS_SIMULATOR_ARCH` | `arm64` or `x86_64` simulator build selection. |
| `AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG` | JSON probe profile path. |
| `AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME` | Local game path for probes; do not commit this into profiles. |
| `AETHERKIRI_RENDER_BACKEND` | Probe backend override. |
| `AETHERKIRI_DIAGNOSTICS` | Enables runtime diagnostics in release builds without showing the desktop UI log panel. |
| `AETHERKIRI_UI_LOG` | Enables the desktop loading/runtime UI log panel. Keep it off in user-facing release builds unless diagnosing a problem. |
| `AETHERKIRI_INPUT_TRACE` | Enables engine/layer input traces. |
| `AETHERKIRI_PERF_LOG_INTERVAL` | Performance log interval in seconds. |
| `AETHERKIRI_FRAME_SPIKE_MS` | Logs frames slower than this threshold. |
| `AETHERKIRI_VERBOSE_RENDER_LOG` | Enables verbose render logging in the Godot shell. |
| `AETHERKIRI_LIVE_FPS_LOG` | Writes runtime FPS/performance diagnostics to the given file path. |
| `AETHERKIRI_IOS_DIAGNOSTICS` | iOS convenience switch for device diagnostics; use it with `devicectl --console`. |
| `AETHERKIRI_IOS_FILE_LOG` | With `AETHERKIRI_IOS_DIAGNOSTICS`, writes `user://aetherkiri-ios-live.log` when no explicit `AETHERKIRI_LIVE_FPS_LOG` is set. |

## Build Commands

Use `./build.sh <platform> <debug|release>`.

```bash
./build.sh macos debug

./build.sh --clean macos release
```

## Platform Build And Launch

macOS debug:

```bash
./build.sh macos debug
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

macOS release:

```bash
./build.sh macos release
open -n out/godot/macos/release/AetherKiri.app
```

iOS Simulator:

```bash
./build.sh ios debug --simulator --simulator-arch=arm64
xcodebuild \
  -project out/godot/ios-simulator/debug/AetherKiri.xcodeproj \
  -scheme AetherKiri \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)' \
  build
```

iOS device:

```bash
./build.sh ios release
xcodebuild \
  -project out/godot/ios/release/AetherKiri.xcodeproj \
  -scheme AetherKiri \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY='Apple Development' \
  build
xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device <device-identifier> \
  /path/to/AetherKiri.app
```

Android debug:

```bash
./build.sh android debug --abi=arm64-v8a
adb install -r out/godot/android/debug/Aether-debug.apk
adb shell monkey -p org.github.krkr2.aetherkiri \
  -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
```

Android release:

```bash
./build.sh android release --abi=arm64-v8a
```

The release APK is unsigned unless a release keystore is configured.

Web debug:

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
./build.sh web debug
npm install
npm run web:dev:debug
```

Web release:

```bash
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
npm install
npm run web:build:release
npm run web:dev:release
```

The native side module is written to
`apps/godot_app/bin/web/<debug|release>/aether_kiri_godot.wasm`. The complete
Godot Web export is written to `out/godot/web/<debug|release>/`, with
`index.html` as the browser entry point. Upload the contents of
`out/godot/web/release/` to static hosting or a CDN for production.

Web exports are built for threaded, SIMD-enabled WebAssembly. They need
cross-origin isolation headers when served in a browser, which the
TypeScript/Vite dev server provides for local testing. Production servers must
send these headers on the app shell, JavaScript, wasm, pck, and asset files:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

Also configure `application/wasm` for `.wasm` files and
`application/octet-stream` for `.pck` files. Web currently uses Emscripten's
virtual filesystem through a conservative platform shim in
`cpp/core/environ/web/Platform.cpp`. Cloud Web deployments cannot read user game
files from server environment variables; the product import path is the browser
file/directory picker. After user authorization, local `File`/`Blob` objects are
mounted read-only under `/webgames/<id>` with Range reads, so multi-GB packages
do not pass through `copyToFS` or MEMFS. Saves, game configuration, and other
runtime writes are persisted under the current site's IndexedDB-backed
`/userfs`.

For automated local testing only, run
`AETHERKIRI_GAME_ROOT=/absolute/path AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START=1 npm run web:dev:release`.
Use `AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START_INDEX` or `AETHERKIRI_WEB_AUTO_START_NAME` when
multiple roots are configured. These are only Vite local-development shortcuts.

GitHub Actions Web builds restore `web-vcpkg-bundle` when it exists. Run the
manual `Web Vcpkg Bundle` workflow after changing Web vcpkg ports, triplets, or
dependency versions; otherwise the first Web Build must compile the full
wasm32-emscripten dependency set and can take tens of minutes. The Web Build
workflow also saves vcpkg, emsdk, and ccache state on failure so reruns do not
throw away a completed dependency build.

On iOS/iPadOS, copy games through the Files app into:

```text
On My iPad/iPhone -> AetherKiri -> Games
```

Return to AetherKiri and tap refresh.

## Runtime UI Flow

The Godot shell mirrors the old mobile app flow:

1. Home page scans known games.
2. On iOS/iPadOS, users copy games through Files and tap refresh.
3. On platforms with file-system access, the primary action can import/select a
   directory or package.
4. Game detail page shows path, play time, scrape/cover actions, rename/remove,
   and launch.
5. Launch switches to a full-page loading console. New log lines should
   auto-scroll to the bottom.
6. After startup succeeds, the shell hides and the game viewport fills the app.
7. Settings persist renderer, performance overlay, frame limit, orientation,
   and developer toggles.

## Input Pipeline

Godot events are handled in `apps/godot_app/scripts/main.gd` and forwarded to
`AetherKiriPlayer`, then through `EngineLoop` into TVP input events.

Important rules:

- Desktop mouse events may trigger a small forced tick to keep click/text reveal
  responsive.
- Mobile touch events must not also forward Godot's emulated mouse events.
  Otherwise one tap can become two KiriKiri clicks.
- Mobile touch should rely on the normal frame loop instead of extra forced
  ticks unless there is a measured reason.
- Save/load/gallery compatibility Enter fallbacks belong in
  `LayerManager.cpp`, and should only target visible, enabled selection layers.

## Test Profiles And Probes

Committed profiles live in `tests/profiles/`. They must be portable and must
not contain machine-local absolute paths. Use environment variables for local
games:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/smoke_test.gd
```

Step render probe:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/step_render_probe.gd
```

Input/performance probe:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri \
  --script res://scripts/perf_input_probe.gd
```

Common profile fields:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `game_path` | Optional portable game path. Prefer empty in committed profiles. |
| `backend` | Renderer name, usually `Godot Native`. |
| `surface_size` | Engine render size, for example `[1280, 720]`. |
| `window_size` | Probe window size. |
| `coord_size` | Coordinate space used by clicks. |
| `startup_timeout_frames` | Startup wait limit. |
| `warmup_frames` | Frames to wait after startup before measuring. |
| `after_click_frames` | Default wait after each configured click. |
| `measure_frames` | FPS measurement window. |
| `clicks` | Ordered click steps with `x`, `y`, optional `name`, and optional `after_frames`. |
| `perf_input` | Extra click/frame settings for input latency probes. |

## Validation Checklist

Before pushing engine/render/input work, run the narrowest checks that cover the
change:

```bash
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --headless \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --check-only \
  --quit
```

Build checks:

```bash
./build.sh macos debug
./build.sh macos release
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
./build.sh ios release
./build.sh android debug --abi=arm64-v8a
./build.sh web debug
```

Renderer migration checks:

```bash
rg "F[l]utter|f[l]utter|A[N]GLE|Platform[ ]Graphics" \
  README.md README.zh-CN.md apps bridge build CMakeLists.txt
rg "u[n]official-angle|l[i]bEGL|l[i]bGLESv2" \
  CMakeLists.txt bridge cpp build vcpkg.json
build/validate_godot_native.sh
build/validate_gpu_bridge.sh
```

Manual game smoke:

- Open a game.
- Reach the title page.
- Start or load a save.
- Verify mouse/touch input.
- Verify text reveal and click-to-complete text behavior.
- Open menu.
- Verify audio.
- Save once.
- Exit back to shell.
- Check FPS and frame spike logs.

When a game has been manually smoke-tested or flow-tested, update
`doc/verified_games.md` before committing the validation work. Record the exact
game title, platform/build, import path, verified scope, result, and the
verifier's GitHub handle or profile link. Do not record machine-local game
paths in the verified-games list. Keep the localized
`doc/verified_games.zh-CN.md` list in sync when updating public compatibility
notes.

## Debugging Notes

For hard-to-describe performance, input, rendering, or native failures, start with a [unified diagnostic session](diagnostics.md):

```bash
python3 tools/diagnose.py run android
```

Reproduce the symptom, tap **标记问题** in the app, and press Enter in the terminal. The tool creates a ZIP containing structured events, platform evidence, and a bounded summary. The individual environment variables below remain available for narrow experiments, but no longer need to be assembled manually for routine captures.

Release builds do not continuously drain runtime logs or update the UI log panel
by default. This keeps normal user builds from paying the per-frame logging/UI
cost. Enable only the diagnostics you need:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_DIAGNOSTICS=1 ...
AETHERKIRI_UI_LOG=1 ...
AETHERKIRI_INPUT_TRACE=1 ...
AETHERKIRI_FRAME_SPIKE_MS=20 ...
AETHERKIRI_VERBOSE_RENDER_LOG=1 ...
AETHERKIRI_LIVE_FPS_LOG=/tmp/aetherkiri-live.log ...
```

Native desktop builds intentionally ignore `AETHERKIRI_AUTO_START_GAME` and
`AETHERKIRI_AUTO_OPEN` unless automation is explicitly enabled. This prevents a
normal debug/release app launched from Finder from inheriting stale global
`launchctl` debug variables and jumping straight into the previous game. For
native automation runs, opt in explicitly:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_ENABLE_AUTO_START=1 \
AETHERKIRI_AUTO_START_GAME=/path/to/game \
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

For macOS release logging, run the app binary directly so it inherits the shell
environment:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_DIAGNOSTICS=1 \
AETHERKIRI_UI_LOG=1 \
AETHERKIRI_FRAME_SPIKE_MS=20 \
out/godot/macos/release/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

On iOS device:

```bash
xcrun devicectl device process launch \
  --device <device-identifier> \
  --terminate-existing \
  --console \
  --environment-variables '{"AETHERKIRI_IOS_DIAGNOSTICS":"1","AETHERKIRI_INPUT_TRACE":"1","AETHERKIRI_FRAME_SPIKE_MS":"20"}' \
  com.liuyu.aetherkiri.kr37s
```

The desktop UI log panel is not shown on mobile. Use `--console` or device
syslog/crash logs for iOS release diagnostics. Use `--console` only when
actively collecting logs, because it waits for the process and can keep a
terminal session occupied.

## Code Change Guidelines

- Keep the Godot app as the product shell.
- Keep local test paths out of committed project settings and profiles.
- Prefer backend-specific fixes over broad behavior changes in the engine core.
- Do not silently downgrade performance paths to Debug CPU.
- Treat `bridge/engine_api` as a stable boundary.
- Add plugin compatibility only when behavior is real or intentionally
  documented; avoid pretending unsupported APIs succeeded.
- Preserve user work in the working tree. Do not reset or revert unrelated
  files.
